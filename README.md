Self Destructing Email
======================

A PHP application to send self destructing emails.
All self-destructing email services out there today send a link to their own website and when the viewer clicks on the link, they see the message on said 3rd party website. The message then gets deleted.

However, this self destructing email actually delivers the email right into the receivers inbox, no going to 3rd party website required.

The receiver has to allow embedded HTML images.
